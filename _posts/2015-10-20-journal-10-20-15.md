I feel really anxious today. I know it's not coming from coffee. 

I was planning on going to the gym but I still feel under the weather, I figure it's probably a bad idea. Perhaps that is the source of my anxiousness.

I need to get better at starting work with a productive 2.5 hours time slot so I can gauge my progress. Getting stack doing non work related stuff at work can drag on and then it bites me in the ass at night.

If I had to sum things up I am just having a down day, especially right now since it's pretty much the end of my day.

#Self-Discipline

Did OK overall. I experienced a bit of hunger at night, munched on some walnuts. Aside from that things went OK.

#Be Present

No meditation again. If I leave my work I never end up doing it. It has to happen earlier.

#Creative Gratitude

...I got nothing.
