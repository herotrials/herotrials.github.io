I didn't have a very strong action oriented day. There are a lot of meetings I have to be in on Monday, every two weeks and they burn me out. At least I went to the gym.

Squats are brutal.

#Self-Discipline

Workout day with the implied cheat meal. In reality I ate what I normally eat with some extra stuff added in. Overall it went OK, then again this is the easy day, let's see what happens tomorrow.

#Be Present

No meditation. Nothing spectacular, just trying to be in the moment.

#Creative Gratitude

I am grateful that my wife seems to be doing better in her pregnancy. It might be hard that I have to take the kids in the morning and then work at night but it's all worth it when I see her smile.
